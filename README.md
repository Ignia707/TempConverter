# TempConverter App

This is a simple, modern web application built with React to convert temperatures between Celsius and Fahrenheit. It serves as a practical project to showcase the use of React functional components, props, and state management to create a dynamic and interactive user interface

### ✨ Features

- **Temperature Display:** Displays the current temperature and unit of measurement

- **Unit Conversion:** Buttons to seamlessly convert the temperature between Celsius and Fahrenheit

- **Increment/Decrement:** Buttons to easily increase or decrease the temperature value

- **Client-Side Routing:** The application uses React Router to handle navigation to an "About" page without a full page reload

### 🛠️ Technologies Used

- `React.js`: The core library for building the user interface

- `JavaScript`: For all the application logic and state management

- `HTML5 / CSS3`: For the structure and styling of the components

- `react-router-dom`: For client-side routing

### 🚀 How to Run the Project Locally

Follow these steps to get the project up and running on your local machine

1. **Clone the Repository:**
   `git clone [your_repository_url]`

2. **Navigate to the Project Directory:**
   `cd [your_repository_name]`

3. **Install Dependencies:**

4. **Start the Development Server:**
   `npm run dev` &rarr; to run the app in development mode and open it in your browser at `http://localhost:3000`

### 📚 Learnings from this Project

- **Component-Based Architecture:** Breaking down the UI into smaller, reusable components (`Card`, `Button`, `Navbar`).

- **Props:** The one-way data flow from a parent component to a child component.

- **`useState` Hook:** Using state to give components "memory" and create dynamic, interactive UIs.

- **Event Handling:** Attaching functions to UI elements (like buttons) to trigger state changes.

- **React Router:** Implementing basic client-side routing for multi-page applications.
